# This is the STAT3011 Project II 

## What we need to do in the project 

1. K mean cluster
2. BG/NBD prediction and check RSS of linear vs BG/NBD
3. Ppt
4. Report
5. Weekness of liner regression in orginal (multimulticollinearity)

## To do list in 14/3 meeting 

1. K mean cluster have planned 
2. check RSS of linear vs BG/NBD (delete outline to check accuracy only, aim: make the RSS of BG/NBD must better) (Anthony)
3, Weekness of linear (VIF, correlation matrix,...) 
4. Ppt :  <This should be attached ppt link>
5. Report
